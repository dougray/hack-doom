# Level Editing #
To build levels for Hack Doom you're going to need a Doom level editor.  At the moment I recommend [Doom Builder](http://doombuilder.com).  Hack Doom levels make extensive use of Action Code Script ([ACS](http://www.zdoom.org/wiki/ACS)) and as a result the map options created MUST be set to "Doom in Hexen format." If you do not, you will not get the SCRIPTS lump in the resultant WAD file and scripts will not function.

When making a level due to the way scripting works you'll need to also create a __LOADACS__ lump as described in the __Assets__ documentation. You'll also need to assign each Hackdoor a sector ID tag (1-99 or up to two digits) and make a note of them for Hack Doom server configuration.  You can find all the core scripts in the *assets* subdirectory of this repository for source code and documentation of them in the __Assets__ documentation in *docs*.
