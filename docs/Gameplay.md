# Gameplay #
Hack Doom's objective is simple:  reach the final switch in a level as fast as possible.  However to do so a team is going to need to work together and employ both gaming and hacking skills to succeed.

# Team Composition #
Teams are comprised of 2 - 8 players and broken into two components, __Control__ and __Marines__.

## Control ##
Control is the hacker team component.  Its 1 - 4 players will be responsible for solving the challenges presented on the scoreboard.  Their challenges will not only provide points for their team but also allow Marines to proceed into new areas, provide PowerUp drops for Marines, as well as accidentally or on purpose spawn enemies for Marines.  However, new challenges must be unlocked by Marines so they will need to take an active interest in helping the Marines survive as well as finishing the challenges.

## Marines ##
Marines is the gamer team component.  Its 1 -4 players will be responsible for advancing through the level and keeping the team moving forward.  Unlike Control they are given only one life each and if they all die their entire team will be eliminated!  Their actions in a level will not only provide points for their team but also allow Control to unlock new core challenges for Hackdoors, allow Control to unlock edge challenges for PowerUps, as well as destroying enemies for points.  However, Hackdoors and PowerUps must be unlocked by Control so they will need to keep an active interest in searching for secret areas and switches as well as survival and mayhem.
